This is a "simple" application to compute ELO-based rating for go players. It
requires Python to run. 

To compute ratings, you feed game results to the program. Game results consist
of the two players's id or ratings, the winner, the number of handicap and the
game condition. The player's id is his id in the database. The game conditions
are categorized into three tournament classes based mainly on the time limit
used in the game.

This system is based on the European Go Federation ratings system.
http://www.europeangodatabase.eu/EGD/EGF_rating_system.php. But the programmer
is not affiliated in anyway with EGF, and any failings of this program should
not be attributed to EGF.
