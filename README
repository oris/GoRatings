This is a "simple" application to compute ELO-based rating for go players. It
requires Python and Google Spreadsheet to run. Presently, you need to know
Python and you need to be familiar with the Linux command line to use it.

To compute ratings, you feed game results to the program. Game results consist
of the two players's id or ratings, the winner, the number of handicap and the
game condition. The player's id is his id in the database. The game conditions
are categorized into three tournament classes based mainly on the time limit
used in the game.

This system is based on the European Go Federation ratings system.
